# getting-to-philosophy
[Interview code example] Your goal is to build a full-stack app that takes a Wikipedia URL as input, and display the path taken from clicking the first link of each page until you get to the Philosophy article. This app should have a front-end form that interacts with a back-end API you’ve built, and it should store the paths taken in a database you’ve designed.
